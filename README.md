# Spam Detection in emails. 

This project is an extension of the previous [Email Spam Classification Project](https://github.com/somaksanyal97/Email-Spam-Classifier).In the previous project, a combined dataset with 17570 email samples where used along with their labels to detect spam / ham using traditional ML algoriths in a supervised learning setting. 

In this project, we have used email samples of 6046 entries and have implemented several ML and DL algorithms to the check the performance of these algorithms on email spam classification. The precision is noted with importance for each of these aglorithms and hyperparater tuning has been used to improve model performance.
